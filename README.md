# Monty Hall Problem

The Monty Hall problem is a famous probability puzzle that challenges our intuition about making choices under uncertainty. It's named after the host of a TV game show, Monty Hall. The problem goes as follows:

1. You are presented with three doors, one of which hides a valuable prize (e.g., a car), while the other two conceal less desirable prizes (e.g., goats).
2. You choose one door without opening it.
3. Monty Hall, the host, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the other two doors, revealing a goat.
4. Now, you face a choice: stick with your initial choice or switch to the other unopened door.

The Monty Hall problem demonstrates that the optimal strategy to maximize your chances of winning is to **always switch doors**. This may seem counterintuitive, but running simulations can help illustrate the concept.

## Simulating the Monty Hall Problem

In this repository, we provide a simple Python script that simulates the Monty Hall problem. You can run the script to see the results of multiple simulations, which should provide a clear understanding of why switching doors is the preferred strategy.

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Python script with the command: `python montehall.py`.

The script will simulate the game and print the results, showing the advantage of switching doors.

Enjoy exploring the Monty Hall problem, and feel free to use the simulation code as a learning resource!
